🧬 Cyber Security Career Path: Malware Analyst
Role Focus: Analyze, reverse-engineer, and understand malicious software to detect, mitigate, and prevent cyber threats.

🧠 About the Role
Malware Analysts—also known as reverse engineers—dissect suspicious or malicious software to understand its behavior, capabilities, and impact. This role combines low-level programming, system internals, and forensic analysis to uncover how malware works and how to defend against it.

If you’re fascinated by how things work under the hood and enjoy breaking down binaries, this role is for you.

🎯 Responsibilities
🔎 Perform static analysis: reverse-engineer malware binaries without executing them, often using tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2

⚙️ Conduct dynamic analysis: execute malware in isolated environments (sandboxes) to monitor behavior in real-time

📝 Document technical findings and produce threat intelligence reports for use by other defenders and incident responders
