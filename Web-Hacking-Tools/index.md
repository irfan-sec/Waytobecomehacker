## ⚖️ Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### ✅ DO:
- Test only on applications you own or have explicit permission to test
- Use responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities found
- Practice on dedicated vulnerable applications and labs
- Follow bug bounty program rules and scope

### ❌ DON'T:
- Test on applications without permission
- Cause damage or disruption to services
- Access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- Ignore responsible disclosure practices
