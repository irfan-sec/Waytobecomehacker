# Mastering Burp Suite: A Learning Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This document is my personal roadmap for mastering Burp Suite, the industry-standard toolkit for web application penetration testing. I will add my notes to each section as I progress through the different levels of mastery.

---

## Level 1: The Beginner - The Traffic Inspector üïµÔ∏è

**Goal:** To understand and control the flow of traffic between a browser and a target. This is the foundation for everything else.

### Modules to Master:
* **Proxy (Intercept):** The core of Burp. I will learn to catch, forward, and drop requests and responses to see them in their raw format.
* **Proxy (HTTP History):** The logbook of all traffic. I will learn to use this to find interesting requests to analyze later.
* **Target (Scope):** A critical first step. I will learn to define a scope to focus only on my target, reducing noise and keeping my testing organized.

## Level 2: The Intermediate - The Manual Attacker üë®‚Äçüíª

**Goal:** To actively manipulate and replay individual requests to find basic vulnerabilities.

### Modules to Master:
* **Repeater:** This is for manual testing. I will practice sending interesting requests from the Proxy History to Repeater, modifying parameters (like user IDs, filenames, or commands), and analyzing how the server's response changes.
* **Decoder:** A utility for converting data between different formats, like Base64, URL, and HTML encoding.

## Level 3: The Advanced - The Automation Specialist ü§ñ

**Goal:** To automate sending thousands of requests to find vulnerabilities at scale that would be impossible to find manually.

### Modules to Master:
* **Intruder:** Burp's powerful automated attack tool. I will learn the different attack types (Sniper, Battering Ram, etc.) to perform tasks like brute-forcing login forms, fuzzing for input vulnerabilities (like SQL Injection), and discovering hidden content.
* **Sequencer:** An advanced tool for analyzing the randomness of session tokens to see if they are predictable.


---

## Level 4: The Expert - The Extender üõ†Ô∏è

**Goal:** To customize and extend Burp Suite's capabilities to fit any testing scenario.

### Modules to Master:
* **Extender (BApp Store):** I will learn to find, install, and use popular extensions from the community that add new features and scanning capabilities to Burp.
* **Extender (APIs):** A long-term goal is to learn how to write my own Burp extensions using Python to automate custom attacks and workflows.
